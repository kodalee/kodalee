<li>Hey there! My name is Koda and I'm a software engineer with a passion for web development.</li>
<li>I've been fascinated by computers since I was eight years old and have always loved learning new programming languages and techniques.</li>
<li>While I'm dedicated to my work, I also make time for hobbies and interests outside of coding.</li>
<li>I enjoy exploring new hobbies, meeting new people, and pushing myself out of my comfort zone.</li>
<li>Currently, I'm getting ready to pursue my Master's degree in software engineering to continue growing my skills and knowledge.</li>
<li>I'm excited to see where my passion for technology takes me next and am always open to connecting with new people who share the same interests.</li>
