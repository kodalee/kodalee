<li>Hey there! My name is Koda and I'm a software engineer with a passion for web development.</li>
<li>I've been fascinated by computers since I was eight years old and have always loved learning new programming languages and techniques.</li>
<li>While I'm dedicated to my work, I also make time for hobbies and interests outside of coding.</li>
<li>I enjoy exploring new hobbies, meeting new people, and pushing myself out of my comfort zone.</li>
<li>Currently, I'm getting ready to pursue my Master's degree in software engineering to continue growing my skills and knowledge.</li>
<li>I'm excited to see where my passion for technology takes me next and am always open to connecting with new people who share the same interests.</li>

<h2>What I'm up to. ðŸ¤”</h2>
<p>I'm currently working on some exciting projects that keep me busy day and night. I'm putting all my energy into a senior project called PhysiRec, which is a School PE Application that simplifies the process of independent and on-campus activity tracking. With PhysiRec, we're moving away from the ancient method of pen and paper, making it easier than ever for students to track their progress and stay on top of their fitness goals.</p>

<p>Alongside PhysiRec, I'm also working on a side project called "Dashie." It's a user-friendly dashboard system that product providers can use to make it easier for their users to navigate and access their services. I love working on side projects like this because it allows me to think outside the box and explore new areas of technology.</p>

</p>Speaking of exploring new areas, I've also been diving deep into the world of computer engineering and IoT systems. I find it fascinating to think about how technology can be used to create new solutions and solve real-world problems. It's amazing to see how IoT systems can be used to automate tasks, gather data, and make our lives easier.</p>
